\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Introduction}
This document provides an understanding of \gls{igo}, a ticket vending machine (\gls{tvm}) which shall be used in Canada, Montreal, Quebec. 


\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to collect, analyse and define needs and features of an online Ticket Vending Machine system (iGo) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It focuses on the features expressed by stakeholders which they would like to see in their application. This document provides details of how iGo - an online ticket vending machine fulfills these needs.It  describes the problems graphically with the context of use modeling, problem domain modeling, stakeholders modeling and use case modeling for different perspectives.
\section{Scope}
This document applies to the Online Ticket Vending Machine(or System) (called iGo)  in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, mainly for metros and buses. iGo plays as an online platform  allowing  travellers  to top up their \gls{opus} cards and manage \gls{stm} transactions themselves. iGo does not include the development and maintenance part of STM system and physical STM Ticket Vending Machines in STM offices.



\chapter{Product Overview}

\section{Problem Statement}
Most of transportation we utilize every day in Montreal, Quebec, Canada is given by STM (Montreal Transit Corporation) with buses and metros. The travellers have either have to buy re-loadable OPUS card or one time usable tickets. The travellers must have to reload their card every week or every month. In order to top up their OPUS card, travellers often wait for a long queue in front of \gls{TVM} machines and STM office stations. The travelling process could be interrupted due to the fact that people usually forget to top up their OPUS card on time. \\ \\

iGo is an online Ticket Vending Machine Web Application that integrates with STM OPUS Card reloading system. People can connect and top up their OPUS cards online using their desktops or mobile devices at home. The payment can be made using debit, credit cards or via Paypal.

\section{iGo Description}
The solution is intended to build an online web application that enables \gls{traveller} to register, login, link and top up their OPUS cards. The similar system exist in Toronto Public Transport. iGo will establish a communication with the STM and manipulate data related to OPUS card. This system will allow user to top-up their cards from their home and not wasting time waiting in queue. \\

A customer will be required to sign up an account with iGo on their first time. In order to top up or make transactions, a traveller is required to link their OPUS card number (displaying on their OPUS card)  with their registered iGo Account. Once user has signed up successfully and linked their OPUS card, they shall be able to see all the transactions made over their account. A traveller will be able to use their existing OPUS cards to travel in Montreal (Quebec, Canada) via buses and metros operated by STM. In this way, the solution will have backward compatibility.\\

\begin{figure}[h!]
  
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/opus-back.jpg}
  \centering
  \caption{Sample image of photo-OPUS card with the unique card number displaying on the back side, provided by STM (Montreal, Quebec, Canada)\cite{card_opus}
}
\end{figure}

iGo must be able to provide the following functionalities to  travellers:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A traveller shall be able to register to an iGo account online, with their email address and be able to link their OPUS card number to their iGo account.
  \item A traveller shall be able to make a payment transaction to top-up opus card linked to their account. After login, a traveller will select a top-up amount. The transaction could be made via Credit Card, Debit Card or PayPal. 
  \item A traveller shall be able to see the OPUS card balance or expiry date of top-up. 
  \item A traveller shall be able to view the OPUS transactions, and must be able to print out or export that transactions.
   \item A traveller shall be able to set up scheduled payment for their OPUS card. 
  \item A traveller shall be able to use their OPUS card to go through buses or metros. The OPUS scanner at STM gates and STM buses must be able to detect if the OPUS card has a enough balance or not.
  \item A traveller shall be able to unlink any OPUS cards under their iGo account.
  \item A traveller shall be able to add more than one OPUS cards under one iGo account.

\end{enumerate}

iGo will communicate each transaction to STM System and obtain the confirmation of the transaction. Gradually, a transaction will be considered complete by STM once it has been paid successfully and it has been approved by STM. iGo will connect with STM System to make sure transactions are successfully made.\\

While sigining up, if IGo System detects the email has been used by another user, the user shall have to sign up using other email. If STM determines that the STM card number is linked to another existing iGo account, a traveller will not be able to link this OPUS card number to their iGo account unless other user unlink the opus card from their account. In all cases, iGo is required to display an explanation of the problem. \\

iGo will also maintain its internal log of transactions to facilitates resolving ambiguities arising from a connection failure in the middle of transactions between iGo and STM System. Entries will be made in the log when a traveller registers an account, logs in and  working on their their login session. \\

\end{figure}

\subsection{Project Assumption}

For this project, iGo does not implement STM Card Readers which will be installed on buses and metros entries. The supposition that is made that STM will execute and introduce STM Card Readers which will have the option to distinguish a STM card by its number, checking its equalization and refreshing it in STM's framework.



\chapter{Context of Use}
We use the user-centric context of use framework \cite{contextofusecasekamthan}  to identify and classify factors that influence the utility and usability of iGo.\\

\setlength{\tabcolsep}{18pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{longtable}[!htbp]{ |p{3cm}|p{12cm}| }
\hline
Factor   & Description  \\
\hline

User &  STM Commuters \\
\hline
Experience & 


The commuters who commute on a daily basis using the mode of transportation as Société de transport de Montréal (STM) Bus service as well as the metro service will have their NFC enabled OPUS cards linked to the iGo web application. The interface of the iGo application will have the interface similar to the current system so that the learning curve will not be high and it would be easy for the commuters to accommodate the technology (i.e. understanding the functionality of the OPUS cards, features, etc.). The users who have experience with online purchasing of the goods would find it easy to familiarise themselves with the web app. Moreover, for the users who are not accustomed to online shopping or any online purchase will be provided with a list of guidelines which are needed to be followed to get the benefits of the system.

    \\
\hline
Education &

The commuters who are not familiar with English and French, wont be able to utilise the iGo web application. Moreover, the users who are not accustomed to the computers or mobile won't be able to use the application. So, it's necessary for the commuters to learn the aforementioned things.

 \\
 \hline
Physical Characteristics    &
The users who are visually impaired and who cannot understand the aforementioned languages cannot operate the iGo web service because there is no inbuilt translation and text-reading feature inscribed in the application.
  \\
  \hline
Cognitive Characteristics & 

The people who are familiar with the two languages, as well as have a wide experience of online surfing would get accustomed easily to the iGo app.
  \\
 \hline
Task &  Establishing a connection between the OPUS card and the web application. Moreover, logging in to perform the daily operations.\\
\hline
Complexity &

The Complexity of any application affects the user response as well i.e. if the complexity of the application is high then the there will be a negative customer response. On the contrary, if the application is easier to understand and more user friendly, then it would boost the customer response.
  \\
\hline
Demands &

There is a high demand for the iGo application, because of the following vulnerabilities pertaining in the current system: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Long line and burden that explorers must face when they recharge their OPUS cards. \item Visiting the STM ticketing machine for recharging the OPUS card which might not be convenient to many.
    \item Furthermore, STM provides passes as well, so the commuter might not be aware of the number of passes and may run out of passes while in transit.
    \item  Montreal city is one of top 3 cutting edge urban communities in Canada and one of 25 innovative urban communities on the planet. iGo suites the interest of individuals who need to appreciate the comfort of innovation in their STM day by day.\cite{tech_city}
\end{enumerate} \\
\hline 

Workflow Controllability & 

The work process of iGo web application ought to be straightforward for clients to get it. Target end clients could be senior natives or little youngsters who are required to utilize iGo effectively.\\
\hline
Safety & 
As iGo is an online application, authentication and security are the major concepts which were kept in mind while developing the application to incorporate the security features.\\
\hline
Criticality & 
iGo is expected to work precisely. Commuters who pick iGo to top up and deal with their OPUS exchanges can utilize OPUS on all STM metros and bus services. Any blunders caused during on the web exchange procedures are not acknowledged.\\
\hline
Environment & Online and language specific.\\
\hline
Physical Environment & 
So, in order to utilize iGo, voyagers are relied upon to have a PC or cell phone associated with the Internet. Gadgets are relied upon to help web perusing.\\

\section{Stakeholders}



  Due to the context of use of iGo, a stakeholder mind map has five main branches:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item iGo Development team 
    \item Quebec Government
    \item Federal Government
    \item STM 
    \item General Public who are travelling via STM transportation in Quebec’s Montreal city. 

\end{enumerate}

iGo development team and STM are two main stakeholder groups without whom iGo project could not succeed. Since iGo and STM are related to a public transportation that operates daily transit services in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, two other stakeholders group must be analysed, which are the Federal Government of Canada and the Quebec Government. The last stakeholder group that directly uses and enjoys benefits of iGo - Montreal city residents must also be analysed. 

\section{Stakeholders description}
After discovering stakeholders via mind mapping method, we come up with two main group of stakeholders:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-User stakeholders: Stakeholders who are not end clients of an iGo framework. They might be influenced by the impact of iGo (emphatically or contrarily) or they may influence the achievement of iGo. We bunch them into Non-User partners gathering.
    \item End-User stakeholders:
Stakeholders who are end clients of an iGo framework, who legitimately advantage from iGo highlights and who straightforwardly interface with iGo framework.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Stakeholders model}
In the wake of examining obligations of partners , we think of the accompanying partner model, portraying their impact to iGo. The further the partners from iGo, the least impact level that they may bring to iGo.


\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
We organize iGo partners dependent on their impact and significance it could be said that without them, iGo will fall flat.
\\
 \begin{itemize}
   \item  Critical
   \begin{itemize}
     \item  The Federal and Quebec Governments has the most noteworthy need since they will give authorizations on iGo's association with STM Cloud just as money for iGo.
    \item The iGO improvement group and STM advancement group has an equivalent impact since they create and keep up iGo framework.\\ \\ \\
   \end{itemize}
   \item  Major
   \begin{itemize}
     \item  The STM agents in the significant rundown as they plan and confirm the necessities of the clients and its representatives.
\item Montreal residents are significant partners since they are immediate clients of the framework. Their inputs and their needs are critical to the accomplishment of iGo.

   \end{itemize}
    \item  Minor
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Neighborhood organizations who administration clients to top up OPUS cards through their OPUS scanners are the least impact partners. They have no duties and less to state about iGO.

   \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}

\section{Problem Domain Model}

% domain model description
Followings are the concepts that are depicted in the domain model:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item STMUser: A generic term of the user who interact with the IGo system, for the IGo system, the potential user including regular citizen, student, senior citizen, children and differently abled user.
  \item OPUSCard: The physical artifact that helps the user to interact with the system.
  \item IGoAccount: For the sake of the using the system more convenient, a specific IGo account is created for each user.
  \item Transaction: A composition of the functionalities included in the system, the user are able to initialize the transaction,including register the account, inquiry the balance, deposit the money, and obtain invoice.
  \item Payment: Certain transaction will need the user to pay. For example, deposit in the account.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
From the domain model of the IGo system, we can clearly see the properties of each concepts listed above and the relationships between these concepts.
\begin{itemize}
\item Between the IGoAccount and the STMUser, a one-to-one relationship is exist. For the IGo system, each user in the system will be given a unique account to interact with the system.
\item Between the STMUser and the Transaction,a one-to-many relationship is exist. For the IGo system, a user are able to initialize multiple transaction, however for each specific transaction, only one user will be involved.
\item Between the Transcation and the payment, a ont-to-one relationship is exist. For a specific transaction, a unique payment operation will be initialized. And for a specific payment operation,exist a specific transaction only.
\item There is a generalize relationship between STMUser and several specific user type, as mentioned above, regular citizen, student, senior citizen, children and differently abled user.

\item There is a generalize relationship between  Transaction and several specific transcation type, as mentioned above,  register the account, inquiry the balance, deposit the money, and obtain invoice.

\end{itemize}

\section{Use Case Brief}

Register an account in iGo System and carry out successful payment for OPUS card\\
Actor: STM customers/Travellers\\

\textbf{Login} : A STM customer needs to register to iGo system using his/her email address. iGo will authenticate a user with STM system via Remote APIs developed by STM developers. iGo will display error or successful message based on the response returned by the STM to the customer.The Customer must wait to receive a notification from STM inorder to make a payment for the OPUS Recharge.\\ 

\textbf{Link OPUS Card} : After successful Login the iGo system will Link the customers account to the internal STM system wherein further validation will take place and response will be sent by the STM system to customer to choose and enter appropriate payment details for successful payment/recharge of OPUS card.\\ 

\textbf{Make Transaction }: 
Once the payment details are entered by the customer the iGo will connect to the respective banking system of customer to validate entered card details.Before entering the payment details the customer needs to be careful about the details he/she is entering as the details if leaked can lead to negative effects.\\  

\textbf{Schedule payment} : 
If the card is validated successfully the payment is done and the opus Card user gets a receipt of successful payment,else the banking system notifies the iGo  that card details entered are not valid.The iGo then requests customer to make new account and carry out payment process.\\ 

\textbf{View Transaction details} : 
Once a transaction is complete the customer gets the receipt for the successful payment for OPUS card which includes the details of transaction that customer can verify. \\

\chapter{Interview}
Interviews\cite{interview} were conducted with two primary users, an international student and a teaching assistant. Interviews are done to gain more understanding about the system in order to build the correct requirements. The answers to the questions are written in both active and passive voice for the user to have a better understanding. We have done one pilot interview(with TA) and four regular interviews. For the interviews done, we have implemented the funnel technique of interviewing in which we begin from general questions and move to specific questions.

Answer: I prefer driving my own card..\\

Question: Are you comfortable using these devices?\\
Answer: Yes, its been a part of our lives now a days.\\

\textbf{Family Specifics:}\\

Question: Are there any dependents or young members in your family and how many?\\
Answer: No, there is no one dependent on me. \\

\textbf{Specific Questions:}\\

Question: When do you purchase tickets for your travel?\\
Answer: I usually take an OPUS card and load 10 tickets into it because I am not a frequent user, I am an occasional user. When there are any events in the downtown and I have to come a lot in the weekend, then I prefer buying the weekend passes.\\

Question: What are the difficulties you face when purchasing a ticket?\\
Answer: I have to go to the pharmacy to recharge my OPUS card, so I wish there was something through which I can recharge my OPUS without going anywhere and buy the tickets from your own home.\\

Question: Do you have any worst experiences with the STM?\\
Answer: No, its generally okay.\\

Question: Will you prefer a system that enables you to recharge anytime and anywhere?\\
Answer: Of course, that would be perfect, because i have kids and I have to buy tickets for them and we have to rush for the tickets in the morning or any time of the day, so its better if we could recharge the OPUS from the home. \\

Question: Do you encounter the first day of the month problem wherein it is mandatory to load the
card even though you have used it only for 15 days?\\
Answer: Sorry, I am not the right person to ask this question as I am not a frequent user.

Questions: Do you face any problems while performing any transaction ?
Answer: No, its actually fun.

Question: What would love to see changed?\\
Answer: As I mentioned before, that the online reloading the OPUS card would be a great relief for all. I would like to have a digital card, as I have a daughter and she frequently looses her OPUS card.\\

Question: Assume you are using an online application to buy your tickets. To register into the system, do you prefer providing your phone number, email , both / neither? Why?\\
Answer: Yes, I'm okay with providing both information.\\
 

 
Question: Do you  need an option to save your application logged-in in the device so next time the user doesn’t need to login again?\\
Answer: Yes, I would prefer stay logged-in.\\

Question: Would you wish to receive an email or message in advance for scheduling your recharge for OPUS card?\\
Answer: Yes, I would love that because there are many things to remember and we tend to forget things.\\
 
 
Question: If yes, how many days in advance that a user wants to receive an informing email?\\
Answer: yes, one week would be good according to me.\\

Question: Do you think that the concept of digitization would be understood and accepted by all age groups ?\\
Answer: Its a choice, but I see many elderly people using these things. Almost everyone uses virtual cards and so on.\\

Question:Do you think that the change would create any havoc or problems for the people ?\\
Answer: I think there should be some security measures for verifying the picture or any such thing for the reduced rate or any such thing.\\

Question: Do you have some suggestions which could be incorporated by the STM ?\\
Answer: I think they need to be more efficient and reduce long queues and waiting times. Moreover, the interface is very bad, so the user interface should be better.\\
Thank you so much for your time. Mrs. Samia Hilal! It was a pleasure speaking with you. \\

\textbf{Job Title:} Graduate Student\\ 


\textbf{Generic Questions:}\\
Question: How many times you use the STM system per
week in Montreal? \\\\
Answer: I use it almost everyday. Because i do not live in Dt, therefore i need to take the metro to get to school. Except the day i have class, i also go to the library to review the lessons. During the weekend, i will go to the old port to have a walk or go to the supermarket, so i am really a regular customer for STM.\\

Question: For the STM system, what is feature that you like most?\\\\
Answer: I think the STM system is considerable which provides several type of ticket to satisfy the people's needs. For me, I get a student card, so I can get a student discount with fixed amount of money and take the metro and bus unlimited times. As I know, the metro also provides a specific ticket type after 5pm which is less expensive than the normal ticket type.\\


Question: What is the main problem of the STM system from your perspective?\\\\
Answer: That should be renew the OPUS card especially on the weekend. I still remembered once that happened. It was a Saturday, so there was no cashier service, the only way to renew the card is to do it through the machine in the metro station, it was so many people in line, which took me a long time to wait.\\

Question: If the STM system provides an extra service for the online charging, do you think it will be helpful?\\\\
Answer: I think it would be much better, as the majority people are able to be accessible to the internet and most of the people are familiar with the online service, so at least half of the people probably will use the online service and rest can still go to the cashier or use the machine in the metro station. At least, it will not be that crowded.\\
