\chapter{Introduction}
This document provides detailed description of \gls{igo}, an electronic ticketing kiosk of public transportation which shall be designed to facilitate individuals of Quebec, Canada. Description of iGo is realised by including user stories, personas, traceability matrix.

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to provide traceable \gls{ustories} for an online Ticket Vending Machine system (iGo) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Elicitation of persona is relevant to user stories. The data gathered from conducting interviews serve the basis of the user stories in this document. User stories prioritisation is realised by collecting information from external stakeholders which they would like to be see in iGo application. iGo system is implemented by keeping quality concerns in mind. This document also provides glossary (\gls{gigo}) that supports all artifacts of iGo. This artifacts in this document is informed by each other, as well as by artifacts of deliverable 1.
\section{Scope}
This document applies to the Online Ticket Vending Machine (called iGo)  in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, mainly for metros and buses. iGo plays as an online platform  allowing  \gls{travellers}  to top up their \gls{opus} cards and manage \gls{stm} transactions themselves. iGo does not include the development and maintenance part of STM system and physical STM Ticket Vending Machines in STM offices. Scope of implementation is limited to iGo positive user stories.



\chapter{User Stories}
Use case model helps in understanding behaviour resulting from possible interactions with the system. However, User story represents functionality of a system\cite{userstoriesincontext}. As functionality of a system is exposed, user story can help during implementation part. Positive and negative user stories are included. However, negative user story is not designed or implemented and has no acceptance criteria\cite{kamthan2016characterization}.

\section{Global Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item iGo system is developed to connect with STM system via \gls{restapi}s. Therefore, the global constraint of all user stories is the fact that it is assuming the core business logic is handled properly via STM system. iGo will request and receive response from STM with its precise workflow, however, the handling component from STM system is not managed and developed, tested by iGo team.
    \item End user is expected to test and use iGo system by modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari because iGo is developed by Single Web Application in \gls{spring} using \gls{java}. It is supposed to work efficiently with modern web browsers.
    \item iGo system is not accessible if user does not have internet connection, therefore it is expected by iGo team that user has internet connection if they want to use services from STM system or iGo sysrem.
\end{enumerate}

\section{iGo User Stories}
The following are the user stories\cite{userstory} of iGo \gls{usigo} which includes both positive and negative stories. 
\subsection{iGo Registration}
\textbf{User Story 1: }

\chapter{Traceability Matrix }

The traceability matrix\cite{trace} of the iGo system \gls{tmigo}, is linking the requirements through the validation process. The traceability matrix is realized to ensure that all the requirements defined for the iGo system are tested and passed. The TMIGO is a table format containing the requirements and their description along with their source. TMIGO comes in handy when we need to trace the resource origin of the requirements in the long run. 

In the process of creating the traceability matrix , we have ensured that the iGo system that we are creating is on the right track. It also helps us to determine if there are any extra unspecified functionality added to the requirements. Thus, we can manage the scope of the system and keep track of how the project is affected for every change in the development lifecycle.

\chapter{Implementation}

\section{Introduction}


There are a set of user stories which are to be implemented by the project on iGo smart ticket vending machine. Here, the user stories that are to be implemented ensure that the quality attributes are attained by the system and the system implements all the user stories which can be used for improving the existing system. As mentioned previously, we assume that STM maintains REST API through which we can get various details regarding the customers and can perform functionalities on the database. The details contain valid information about the OPUS cards.\\

Here the technology which has been utilised by us for the purpose of the API is Java along with its tools. Moreover, for the development of User Interface, we have used the Spring Framework focuses on the MVC design pattern. The built web application is platform independent and can work on all the browsers which support HTML5 and CSS3. Lastly, the project is tested to work with various inputs and provide a desired output whenever there is an issue/error in the user input. All in all, it can be said that the system is well tested and ready to be deployed in the working environment and would fulfill all the requirements of the users.\\ \\

\section{Quality Attributes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{\textbf{Compatibility}: Our System shall provide co-existence as it will perform its required functions efficiently while sharing a common environment and resources with other systems, without detrimental impact on any other system and it will also be inter operable so that two or more systems can exchange and use information such as vehicle catalog information etc. This has been achieved by use of bootstrap library to render app on all the browser compatibly.} 
    \item{\textbf{Usability}: This system shall be easy to use for input preparation, operation, and interpretation of output and shall provide consistent user interface standards or conventions with our other frequently used systems. It will also be easy for new or infrequent users to learn to use the system as It will provide learnability, operability, user error protection, accessibility and user interface aesthetics. Our system shall increase user confidence and satisfaction by providing user friendly navigation.
    
    \item{\textbf{Reliability} - iGo web app shall be available, accessible when required for use and operational as it is indented to operate despite the presence of hardware or software faults. Moreover, in the event of an interruption or failure, this system will recover the data directly affected and re-establish the desired state of the system. This can be achieved using persistent database.}
    
    \item{\textbf{Security}: Our system shall provide confidentiality by making data accessible only to those authorized who have access through password privacy and prevent unauthorized access and modification of data. Thus, security can be characterized as a system providing non repudiation, confidentiality, integrity, assurance, availability, and auditing. This shall be achieved using spring security as a security layer. Along with authorization, we have also provided encryption facilities which can make the system more secure.}
    
    \item{\textbf{Maintainability}: This system shall be maintainable because it is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components. It shall also be reusable as module that is developed with high cohesion and low coupling can be used in more than one system, or building other assets. It will provide the effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change to one or more of its parts, or to diagnose a product for deficiencies or causes of failures, or to identify parts to be modified. Moreover, it will also be effectively and efficiently modified and tested without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality. This shall be achieved by using Spring MVC.}
    
    \item{\textbf{Portability}: The system can be run on any tomcat server with minimum 128MB RAM. Hence, Considering this, System shall be portable. }
